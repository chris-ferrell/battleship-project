# Project-1-BattleShip_Game

in my First Project, I will be recreating the game Battleship (game)
with the implementation of an Ai opponent.

## Project Description
BattleShip (game) is a strategy-type guessing game for two players. in this game, you will be given a set amount of time and ammo to sink all opponent's ships. you will also receive several special weapons with set cooldowns.


## How To Play
you will be given 60 seconds to place all of your ships on the playing field, if you don't place them in time the computer will randomly place them for you.
once all the ships have been placed on both sides. the computer will select who goes first.
from then you will be given 15 seconds to select coordinates and, click the "Fire" button. you and your opponent will go back and forth attacking until all ships have been sunk or players run out of ammo. if both players run out of ammo the computer will tally up who did the most damage to choose the winner.

#### MVP Goals
- I want to display friendly ships coordinates
- I want to show the locations where the ship has taken damage 
- I want to display the current health of all ships individually
- based upon the amount of health the ship has, the color of the ship changes along with it.
- I want to have the game randomly select who will go first
- have the computer randomly place the ships for the players if they don't place them.

##### Stretch Goals
- add different weapons to attack with.
- on the added specialty weapons give them a cool-down time.
- once a ship reaches %10 of health or lower have the ship blink red.
- listen for active mouse coordinates on the grid.
